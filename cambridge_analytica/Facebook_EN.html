<p>The headlines speak for themselves: Up to 50 million Facebook users had their information used by Cambridge Analytica, a private company, without their knowledge or consent<sup>1</sup>. That's not okay.</p>

<p>This wasn't a data breach, no one hacked into Facebook or stole passwords. This happened through bad app permissions. A few hundred thousand people took a personality quiz, that the developer claimed was for research purposes. That app stored the personal information of the friends of the quiz takers which the researcher then shared with Cambridge Analytica. This data was used to create detailed profiles to target people with controversial political ads.
</p>

<p>Facebook is facing a lot of questions right now but one thing is clear: <span style="font-weight:bold;">Facebook needs to act to make sure this doesn't happen again.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;">Will you join us in asking Facebook to change its app permissions and ensure your privacy is protected by default?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a style="background-color: #0c99d5; display: inline-block; padding: 10px 42px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 200%; min-height: 32px; height: auto; color: #fff; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; text-align: center; text-decoration: none;" href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/campaigns/facebook/?utm_source=newsletter-mofo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=facebook&utm_term=%%jobid%%" alias="button">Sign the Petition</a></p>

<p>If you play games, read news or take quizzes on Facebook, chances are you are doing those activities through third party apps and not through Facebook itself. The default permissions that Facebook gives to those third parties currently includes data from your education and work, current city and posts on your timeline. Surprised? We were too.  </p>

<p>Facebook's current app permissions leave billions of its users vulnerable without knowing it.</p>

<p><a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0c99d5; font-weight: bold;" href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/campaigns/facebook/?utm_source=newsletter-mofo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=facebook&utm_term=%%jobid%%" alias="textlink1">Will you tell Facebook to change its policies to ensure that third parties can't access the information of the friends of people who use an app?</a></p>

<p>At Mozilla, our approach to data is simple: no surprises and user choice is critical. We believe in that not just because it makes for creating good products but because trust is a key factor in keeping the internet healthy.</p>

<p>The internet is transformative because it's a place to explore, transact, connect, and create. Trust is key to that. We're pushing to Facebook to improve its privacy practices not just because of its 2 billion users but for the health of the internet more broadly too.</p>

<p>Yours, with hope &mdash; </p>

<p>Ashley</p>
