<p><strong>I'm reaching out because Mozilla couldn't do what it does without you. </strong> </p>

<p>Thanks to your generous support we've already been able to hit some exciting milestones this year &mdash; and what a year it's been so far!</p>

<p>Last month we hosted a Town Hall with our staff where we talked about our achievements so far and what lies ahead for the rest of 2018. I'd like to share just a couple of those with you today.</p>

<p>We're on the cusp of some <strong>really</strong> exciting things. The internet health issues that we've been working on over the past three years &mdash; that you believe in and support us on &mdash; are increasingly cropping up in the media and in public consciousness.</p>

<p>As you may know, we're pushing in three strategic directions &mdash; trying to shape the agenda on internet health, rallying citizens around campaigns on issues they care about, and connecting the leaders working around the world on these same issues. If you want to learn more about our strategy, take a look at our <a style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #0c99d5;" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MoFo_2020" alias="strategywiki">strategy wiki. </a></p>

<p>This year we've dug in on advocacy and campaign work in an effort to rally citizens like you around tangible issues. One campaign worked behind the scenes to get CloudPets &mdash; a connected toy with egregious privacy practices &mdash; <a style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #0c99d5;" href="https://mic.com/articles/189673/target-and-walmart-stop-selling-the-superhackable-kids-toy-cloudpets-after-pressure-from-mozilla" alias="cloudpets">off the shelves of Walmart and Target</a>, two of the United States' biggest retailers. We also worked with Amazon to improve the privacy disclosures of the Echo Dot for Kids, a home device geared towards children.

<p>We ran a campaign called "Tell Facebook: this can't happen again." A part of this campaign involved having the Mozilla community push Facebook to make small but important <a style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #0c99d5;" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/12/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-congressional-hearing-information-warfare-normal" alias="facebookchanges">changes to their policies</a>, and advocate for Mark Zuckerberg to testify <a style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #0c99d5;" href="https://gizmodo.com/mark-zuckerbergs-eu-testimony-will-be-livestreamed-was-1826188564" alias="zuckpublic">publicly</a> in the EU.

<p>Also in the EU, we've seen a massive mobilization of public opinion in the last few weeks. As a result, MEPs have <a style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #0c99d5;" href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/5/17535874/eu-copyright-law-article-11-13-rejected-first-vote" alias="copyright">shelved proposals</a> that would have forced internet companies to filter the web, and would have introduced an unprecedented tax on linking online. This is a huge step in the right direction, and Mozilla will keep on pushing to modernize copyright in Europe.

<p>With your help, we've increased the number of <a style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #0c99d5;" href="https://medium.com/read-write-participate/plugging-in-on-policy-mozillas-tech-policy-fellowships-9ab77e7433c8" alias="fellows">fellows we're supporting</a> as we aim to connect more leaders whose work tackles issues affecting internet health. One example is Renee diResta, Mozilla's fellow working on media, misinformation and trust. Renee recently <a style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #0c99d5;" href="https://www.wired.com/story/darpa-total-informatio-awareness/" alias="Renee">published a piece in Wired</a> that talks about the need for civic groups like Mozilla to scrutinize powerful tech companies the same way they scrutinize governments. We need watchdogs in civil society, and citizens like you to stand up.</p>

<p>We're increasingly seeing that consumers can change the dialogue &mdash; picking products that bias towards privacy, talking to governments and pushing on companies directly &mdash; and all of us here at Mozilla will work to provide more opportunities to do just that.</p>

<p>Looking forward to see what the rest of 2018 holds.</p>

<p>Cheers...</p>
