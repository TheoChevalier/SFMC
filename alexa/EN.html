<p>%%[IF empty(FirstName) then]%% Hey there, %%[elseif not empty(FirstName) then]%% Dear %%=ProperCase(FirstName)=%%, %%[endif]%%</p>

<p>Amazon is about to release an Echo Dot smart speaker for kids. The company envisions the Alexa-powered device in children's bedrooms, capturing their questions, requests for music and favorite stories.</p>

<p>What could possibly go wrong?!</p>

<p>While Amazon's marketing touts kid-friendly features, it leaves out some very important details about how the Echo Dot will safeguard children's privacy. We've poured over the Echo Dot's product page and we can't find the answer to an important question &mdash; <em>What will Amazon do with the information it collects from kids?</em></p>

<p>This isn't a theoretical question &mdash; it's very real. Amazon will soon be in possession of millions of children's questions, singing, conversations and more. What steps will Amazon take to make sure children's sensitive data is extra safe?</p>

<p><a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0c99d5; font-weight: bold;" href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/campaigns/amazon-echo-kids/?utm_source=newsletter-mofo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=amazon&utm_term=%%jobid%%" alias="textlink1">Join me in asking Amazon to update its product page to tell parents exactly what it will do with children's data.</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a style="background-color: #0c99d5; display: inline-block; padding: 10px 42px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 200%; min-height: 32px; height: auto; color: #fff; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; text-align: center; text-decoration: none;" href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/campaigns/amazon-echo-kids/?utm_source=newsletter-mofo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=amazon&utm_term=%%jobid%%" alias="button">Sign the Petition</a></p>

<p>Amazon begins to sell and ship Echo Dots on May 9th. Consumers deserve this information before they order and have these products in their homes.</p>

<p>Kids' data is at risk and it's time for companies to take this seriously. Cambridge Analytica uncovered the risk of personal data being misused and Consumer Reports recently reported that children are increasingly victims of identity theft. A 2015 hack of VTech's connected toys database exposed the personal information of 12 million children and parents.</p>

<p>In recent interviews, Amazon has shared more about the parental controls they have built into the system and that's great. But they still haven't shared what they will do with the data they collect and how they will take steps to make sure it's safely stored. And we think this information deserves to be front and center in their marketing &mdash; not a secret.</p>

<p><a style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0c99d5; font-weight: bold;" href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/campaigns/amazon-echo-kids/?utm_source=newsletter-mofo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=amazon&utm_term=%%jobid%%" alias="textlink1">Ask Amazon to be upfront with parents about how they are collecting, storing and using kids' information before the product release on May 9!</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a style="background-color: #0c99d5; display: inline-block; padding: 10px 42px; margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 200%; min-height: 32px; height: auto; color: #fff; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; text-align: center; text-decoration: none;" href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/campaigns/amazon-echo-kids/?utm_source=newsletter-mofo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=amazon&utm_term=%%jobid%%" alias="button">Sign the Petition</a></p>

<p>This feels like it should be an easy ask. Parents want to easily find information about how a company is collecting and storing about their kids. And companies who have great data practices, should want to promote them, along with the other core product features. We can &mdash; and will &mdash; get there if we make noise about it. Amazon updating its product page will send a message that companies can't expect to release a data collecting product without sharing information about its data collection and storage practices.</p>

<p>There are so many good things about technology and its potential to help kids grow and learn &mdash; but like any tool families should have a full picture of its risks so that they can make the best decisions for their kids.</p>

<p>Yours,</p>
